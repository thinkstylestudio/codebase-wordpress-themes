Steps!

Create a WordPress site.

Let's say we have a project called "domain.tld".
We're going to create this project using WordPress.
Then we shall create a custom theme called "mytheme".

# Get the code
> git clone https://github.com/Wordpress/Wordpress domain.tld
> cd domain.tld

# Add the theme base code.
> git submodule add https://grok@bitbucket.org/noblestudios/codebase-wordpress-themes.git wp-content/themes/mytheme
> cd wp-content/themes/mytheme

# Get the code!
> git pull

# Now we have the foundations. Let's turn it into our own theme.
1. Edit style.css and change the theme name and other File Headers to be inline with your  new theme.
2. Edit functions.php and either add or remove css/javascript libraries as needed. Also if >= 5.4 you can enable the namespace line which will help resolve potential code conflicts.

# After you've altered the base to be what you need to start developing your new theme - do the following:
> git checkout -b mytheme
> git add .
> git commit -m "Your awesome commit talking about why you changed stuff."
> git remote add mynewremote mygitrepopath
> git push mynewremote
